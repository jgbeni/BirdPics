## 💡 Motivation

Due to human activities and climate change, some migratory bird populations are suffering a significant decline, such as the [Common Swift](https://www.birdguides.com/articles/conservation/study-examines-factors-driving-long-term-common-swift-decline/) (*Apus apus*). In this context, fast and reliable species censuses are key for conservation, but traditional methods are slow and expensive. However, with the popularity of websites such as [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) and [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), the number of accessible observations made by amateur *birders* has grown exponentially. Using Big Data and Machine Learning, we can train models to reliably identify the species in these observations, reducing the cost of species censuses and helping scientists with their conservation efforts.

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project aims to classify three morphologically similar bird genera commonly found across Europe. In this first version, the considered species are:
Common Swallows (*Hirunda rustica*), Common Swifts (*Apus apus*), and Common House Martins (*Delichon urbicum*).
Accurately identifying these species in photographs is challenging due to their overlapping morphology and flight patterns.  
This project explores how deep learning models, fine-tuned via transfer learning, can effectively distinguish between them using carefully cleaned and standardized image data.

### Key Features
- ✅ Custom **Agreement Score** metric to select high-quality observations.  
- 🧹 Automated data cleaning using **CLIP (OpenAI).**  
- ⚙️ Efficient data loading and storage with **HDF5** 
- 🧠 Transfer learning using large image-recognition models: **VGG16**, **VGG19** and **ResNet50**.  
- 📈 Achieved **92% accuracy** on unseen images.

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Collection
All observations across Europe of swallows (*Hirunda rustica*), swifts (*Apus apus*), and martins (*Delichon urbicum*) were retrieved from [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org). From the observations, we retrieved the species guess, image URL, number of observation agreements, and number of observation disagreements (made by iNaturalist users). The last two features were useful for the data cleaning process.

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
This was the most elaborate step:
- Removed observations containing audio files, so the identification power relies only on the images.
- Computed a new quality metric, the **Agreement Score**:

  **`agreement_score = observation_agreements - observation_disagreements`**

  This metric measures the overall degree of confidence in the species' guess.
- Selected the top **12,000 observations per species** with the highest Agreement Score.
- Used **CLIP (OpenAI)** to automatically remove irrelevant or low-quality images (feathers, spectrograms, pictures with no visible birds, etc.), reducing dataset size by over **10%**.
- Final dataset: **24,000 high-quality images** (picking the 8000 top images per species using the Agreement Score).

### 3️⃣ Standardization
- Cropped all images to **square format**.  
- Resized to **224×224 pixels** using **bilinear interpolation**.  
- Randomly split into **training**, **validation**, and **test** sets.  
- Saved all processed data to **HDF5** for fast reading during training.

### 4️⃣ Model Training
- Applied **transfer learning** with **VGG16**, **VGG19** and **ResNet50** pre-trained on ImageNet.  
- Used **data augmentation** to prevent overfitting (rotation, flip, color jitter, etc).  
- Stored fine-tuned model weights and training metrics.
- The **ResNet50** model achieved the best performance with  
  **Test Accuracy: 92%**
